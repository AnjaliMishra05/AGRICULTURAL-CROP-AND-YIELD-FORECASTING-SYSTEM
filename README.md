# AGRICULTURAL-CROP-AND-YIELD-FORECASTING-SYSTEM
This system is proposed for efficient crop yield detection using Machine learning algorithms such as 
KNN and Random forest. Experimental results analysis showed that our proposed method is efficient 
and can achieve better performance. The proposed system helps farmers to decide or choose the crops 
for cultivation and it also predicts yield for a particular crop. Hence the proposed approach provides a 
perception of implementing a more generalized model for yield prediction. 
In the future we can use real-time weather and soil datasets which will be gathered personally by 
equipment or the datasets can be acquired from trusted websites. To further modify the model we 
can combine different classifiers to build one single model which is called Ensemble. By doing this we 
can achieve a level of performance that could not be achieved by a single algorithm. Also, the nature 
of the Dataset affects the analysis therefore, more cleaned and pre-processed can be used for better 
results.
